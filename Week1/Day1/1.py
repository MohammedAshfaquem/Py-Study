# 🐍 Python is a high-level programming language
# → Easy to read, write, and understand (like English)

# 🧠 Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s
# → Official release: 1991

# 💻 Interpreted language
# → code executed line by line .No need to compile before running

# 🎯 General-purpose
# → Used in web development, automation, data science, AI, scripting, etc.

# 📦 Rich standard library
# → Includes modules like math, os, datetime, etc.

# ✍️ Dynamically typed
# → No need to declare variable types (e.g., x = 5 is valid)

# 🔁 Cross-platform
# → Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS

# 🔍 File extension: .py
# → Example: script.py

# 🚀 Popular Frameworks/Libraries
# Web: Django, Flask
# Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
# ML/AI: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, PyTorch

# 🌐 Huge community & open-source
# → Python is maintained and improved by a global community.

# → it is case sensitive

# ✅ Advantages of Python (Key Points)

# ❌ Disadvantages of Python (Key Points)
# 🐢 Slower than compiled languages
# → Interpreted nature causes slower execution

# ⚠️ Runtime errors possible
# → Dynamic typing can lead to hidden bugs (e.g., mixing types)

# 🔋 Not memory efficient
# → Higher memory usage compared to C, C++, Java

# 📱 Weak in mobile development
# → Rarely used for Android or iOS apps

# 🧵 Multithreading limitations (GIL)
# → Global Interpreter Lock prevents true parallel execution in CPython

# 🧪 Dynamic typing may cause confusion
# → Variables can change types unexpectedly
