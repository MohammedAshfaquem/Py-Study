# âœ… 1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
# What it means:
# Django encourages writing code that is reusable and avoids duplication. The idea is: "Write once, use it everywhere."

# Example:
# If you define a model (like a Product), you donâ€™t need to redefine it in multiple places for the database, form, or admin panel â€” Django handles that automatically.

# Why it's important:
# It reduces errors, improves maintainability, and makes your codebase cleaner and more efficient.

# âœ… 2. Built-in Admin Interface
# What it means:
# Django comes with a powerful and customizable admin dashboard that lets you manage application data through a web interface.

# Example:
# Once you define your models, Django can generate a full admin panel where you can:
# Add, update, and delete data
# Manage users and permissions
# Search and filter content

# Why it's important:
# It saves you time because you donâ€™t need to build a back-end interface from scratch.

# âœ… 3. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
# What it means:
# The Django ORM allows you to interact with the database using Python code instead of raw SQL queries.

# Example:
# # Instead of writing SQL...
# SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = 1;

# # You can do this in Django:
# User.objects.filter(active=True)
# Why it's important:
# It makes database interactions more intuitive, secure, and easier to maintain.

# âœ… 4. Security Features
# What it means:
# Django includes built-in protections against many common web vulnerabilities such as:

# SQL Injection
# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
# Clickjacking
# Secure password hashing

# Why it's important:
# Security is crucial in web development, and Django helps protect your apps by default â€” so you donâ€™t have to write all the security logic manually.

# âœ… 5. Scalability and Reusability
# ðŸ”¹ Scalability
# Django is designed to scale well with increasing traffic and data. It supports:
# Caching

# Load balancing

# Asynchronous processing (with Django Channels or Celery)

# Why it's important:
# Big companies like Instagram use Django to handle millions of users. It can grow with your project.

# ðŸ”¹ Reusability
# Django promotes the use of:

# Reusable apps (small, modular components)

# Reusable templates and forms

# Reusable code through custom libraries and third-party packages

# Why it's important:
# You can plug in existing solutions (e.g., authentication, search, payments) without reinventing the wheel.
