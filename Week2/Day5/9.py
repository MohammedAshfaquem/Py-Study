# ✅ 1. WSGI — Web Server Gateway Interface
# It is the standard interface between web servers (like Apache, Nginx with Gunicorn) and Python web apps.
# It handles synchronous requests (i.e., normal HTTP requests: GET, POST).
# Django traditionally used WSGI before Django 3.0.
# Think of WSGI as a one-lane road — handles one request per thread.

# ✅ 2. ASGI — Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface
# It is the modern alternative to WSGI.
# Supports asynchronous programming — handles HTTP, WebSockets, long polling etc.
# Used in Django 3.0 and above to support real-time apps (chat, notifications).
# Compatible with async def views and await.
# Think of ASGI as a multi-lane express highway — multiple requests handled together (more efficient for real-time apps).

# 🔁 WSGI vs ASGI — Quick Comparison

# Requests	        Synchronous only	            Both synchronous & asynchronous
# WebSockets	    ❌ Not supported	              ✅ Supported
# Real-time apps	❌ No	                      ✅ Yes
# Django support	Default before 3.0	           From Django 3.0+
