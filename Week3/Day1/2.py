# Database: An organized collection of data.
# DB Allow to access update delete data .


# Types of Databases:
# Relational Databases (RDBMS) â€“ Data is stored in tables with relationships (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
# NoSQL Databases              â€“ Data is stored in a non-tabular format (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase).
# In-memory Databases          â€“ Data is stored in the system's RAM for quick access (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
# Graph Databases              â€“ Data is represented as a network of nodes and relationships (e.g., Neo4j).
                    

# DBMS
# it stands for Database Management System
# Software to manage and interact with databases.
# it allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete data in efficient way.
# it is milddle layer between user and DB
# it can handle large data efficent way

# Typse Of DBMS
# Hierarchical DBMS       â€“ Data is organized in a tree-like structure.
# Network DBMS            â€“ Data is Organized like a graph structure where data can have multiple relationships.
# Relational DBMS (RDBMS) â€“ Data is stored in tables with rows and columns (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
# Object-Oriented DBMS    â€“ Data is represented as objects (e.g., ObjectDB).
# NoSQL DBMS              â€“ Data is organized in non-tabular format

# Features:
# Data Abstraction        â€“ 
# Data Integrity          â€“ 
# Data Security           â€“  
# Data Independence       â€“ 
# Concurrency Control     â€“ 

# RDBMS:
# it is a type of DBMS
# it stands for Relational DBMS
# it stores data in tables (relations).
# it use sql for querying and Managing
# it support ACID Properties
# it support Normalization

# Examples of RDBMS:
# MySQL
# PostgreSQL
# SQLite
# Oracle
# Microsoft SQL Server

# ðŸ“Œ DBMS vs RDBMS:
# DBMS              # RDBMS
# No relations      # Data stored in relations (tables)
# No normalization  # Supports normalization
# E.g., XML DB      # E.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL,oracle,SQLite etc...
