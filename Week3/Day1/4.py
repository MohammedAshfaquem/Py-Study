# | Definition  | Physical structure with rows and columns              | Theoretical representation of a table in relational theory.  |
# | Structure   | Consists of rows (records) and columns (fields)       | A set of tuples (unordered, unique rows)                     |
# | Duplicates  | Tables may allow duplicate rows (in some DBMS)        | Relations do not allow duplicates                            |
# | Order       | Rows and columns may appear ordered                   | Tuples and attributes are unordered                          |
# | Naming      | Columns and rows usually have names                   | Tuples and Attributes,no strict naming                       |
# | Null Values | Tables can store NULLs (unknown values)               | Traditional relations do not support NULLs                   |
# | Origin      | From database systems (real-world implementation)     | From relational algebra (mathematics)                        |




# âœ… In Simple Terms:
# A relation is a theoretical concept â€” an ideal table with no duplicates, no order, and no nulls.
# A table is the real-world version used in databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc..., and may have duplicates, order, and NULLs.
