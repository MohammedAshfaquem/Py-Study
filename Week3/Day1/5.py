# | What is it?           | A language used to interact  with databases   | A tool to use SQL in PostgreSQL                              |
# | Used for              | Talking to any database (MySQL, Oracle, etc.) | Talking to PostgreSQL database only                          |
# | Standard or Specific? | Standard language (works in all DBs)          | Specific to PostgreSQL                                       |
# | Example               | `SELECT * FROM users;`                        | Same SQL works, plus extra PostgreSQL commands like `\dt`, `\l`|
# | Extra Features        | Basic features only                           | Has extra features in PostgreSQL like JSON, custom functions |


# âœ… Think of it like this:
# SQL = the language (like English for databases)
# PSQL = the PostgreSQL tool that uses that language, with some extra features


# it support some extra data types:
# like array,enum,range,JSON,
# concurrenct and mvcc
