| Used for              | Talking to any database (MySQL, Oracle, etc.) | Talking to PostgreSQL database only                          |
| Standard or Specific? | Standard language (works in all DBs)          | Specific to PostgreSQL                                       |
| Example               | `SELECT * FROM users;`                        | Same SQL works, plus extra PostgreSQL commands like `\dt`, `\l`|

✅ Think of it like this:
SQL = the language (like English for databases)
PSQL = the PostgreSQL tool that uses that language, with some extra features
