# ðŸ”¥ CASCADE in SQL (especially PostgreSQL):
# ðŸ‘‰ What it does:
# When you use CASCADE with DROP, it not only deletes the main object (like a table),
# but also deletes all other dependent objects automatically. 



# ðŸ”¹ What is SERIAL?
# SERIAL is a special data type in PostgreSQL (and some other SQL databases).
# It is used to create a unique auto-incrementing integer column (usually for id/primary key).
# When you insert a new row, you donâ€™t need to give a value for that column â€” SQL will automatically assign the next number.


# ðŸ”¹ Key Point
# ðŸ‘‰ SERIAL is not part of the SQL standard.
# In standard SQL / MySQL you use:
    
# AUTO_INCREMENT (MySQL)
# IDENTITY (SQL Server)
