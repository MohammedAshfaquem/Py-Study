âœ… What is a View in SQL?
A View is like a virtual table.
It doesn't store data, but shows data from one or more real tables using a saved SQL query.

EG:ðŸ“‹ Example Tables
ðŸŸ¦ users table:
id	name	age
1	Akshay	24
2	Priya	30


ðŸŸ¨ orders table:
id	user_id	product
1	1	Laptop
2	2	Mouse


ðŸ”§ Create a View
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Create a view that shows users and their orders
CREATE VIEW user_orders AS
SELECT users.name, orders.product
FROM users
JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;


âœ… This creates a virtual table called user_orders.
ðŸ”Ž Use the View Like a Table
Now you can query it just like a normal table:
SELECT * FROM user_orders;
Result:
name	product
Akshay	Laptop
Priya	Mouse
